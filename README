Scala parser for a limited subset of GPX XML files (as produced by Runkeeper).

== Description ==

GPX is used for GPS data exchange, mapping, and geocaching. The full GPX file
format is described at http://www.topografix.com/gpx.asp. This parser works
on the very limited subset of that format used by Runkeeper (http://runkeeper.com)
for recording the time and track of an activity.

== Building ==

This is a Scala project using SBT / Activator.

To build it, run:

    ./activator compile (to build)
    ./activator test (to run the Specs2 tests)
    ./activator package (to produce a JAR)
